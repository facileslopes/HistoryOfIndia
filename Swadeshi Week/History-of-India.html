		<h1>Prehistoric Era<br>(until 3300BC)</h1>	
		<hr class="left-line">
		<p>It is estimated that hominins first entered into the Indian subcontinent about 2.2 - 2 MYA(million years ago) based on their known presence in Indonesia around 1.8 MYA, and the discovery on stone tools and implements in the Soan River valley at Riwat and the Pabbi Hills at Pakistan. The oldest hominin fossils in the Indian subcontinent belong to Homo Erectus, and date back to around half a million years ago. Archeological evidence has suggested that hominins were scattered until 700,000 years ago, and approximately 250,000 years ago they were spread across the subcontinent, indicated by an abundance of hominin fossils. Modern humans, or homo sapiens, have been predicted to have migrated in small groups to the north-west of the Indian subcontinent 60,000-80,000 years ago, and around 55,000 years ago their existence can be virutally confirmed. Settled life, people who practiced farming and pastoralism instead of foraging, began sprouting near the Indus River around 9,000 years ago, and the practice of farming slowly spread from the West of the river eastwards, and eventually, these settlements near the Indus River would lead to the creation of the Indus valley civilisation.</p>

		<h1>Ancient Era<br>(3300BC - 200BC)</h1>	
		<hr class="right-line">
		<p>The Ancient Era can be divided into two periods: the Bronze age and the Iron age. The Bronze age began in the Indian subcontinent around 3300BC, with the rise of the Indus Valley civilisation. One of the three cradles of civilisation(along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia), the Indus valley civilsation was heavily urban, as large as modern-day France, and at its peak habited around 5 million people. Several hundred cities were settled across the river, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro in modern day Pakistan and Dholavira and Lothal in modern-day India. Their cities were virtualaly identical and had streets laid out in straight grids, and included large baths (the largest being the Great Bath in Mohenjo-Daro) grainaries and sewage disposal pipes. They domesticated cattle and water buffalo, grew wheat, barley and cotton, and traded with Shang China for jade and with the Mesopotamians. The civilisation collapsed in 1900 BC, initially believed due to the Indo-Aryans invading but now believed by most scholars to be the result of the drying up of the Indus rivers. After their collapse, the people migrated towards the Himalayan foothills of the Ganga-Yamuna basin.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Iron age began with the Vedic period brought upon by the Indo-Aryans who had migrated to India around approximately 1800BC, around the time the war chariot was invented. It was around this period of time that the Vedas were composed, and Vedism was developed, which eventually had some of its beliefs assimilated into the larger set of beliefs known as Hinduism. From Vedism, Hinduism adopted the concepts of karma and reincarnation, but also the caste system and idea that people could liberate themselves from the cycle of life, death and reincarnation with the aid of brahmins and rituals. The last concept was discarded by Buddhism, founded by Siddhartha Gautama(563 BC - 483 BC), who would later become known as the Buddha, who argued that anyone could acheive nirvana and be lberated from samsara. Another religion founded around this time was Jainism, propogated by Mahavira. It was also around this time when the Mahabharata and the Ramayana were composed, the two Sanskrit epics.
		<br>
		<br>
		Another important event that occured nearing the end of this period was the creation of the Mauryan Empire, founded by Chandragupta and ruled from Patalipura, its capital on the eastern Ganges. Stretching up the Himalayas into modern day Assam and to the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan at its peak, the empire was the first to unify most of the Indian subcontinent with the exception of South India, and had a poweful military and extensive trade routes streching as far as to Rome. It's most famous ruler, Ashoka, is admired for his justice, wisdom, advocating for peace and tolerance, and the Pillars of Ashoka that had his Buddhist teachings carved into it. The Mauryan empire began the Golden Age of India.

		<h1>Classical Period<br>(200BC - 650AD)</h1>	
		<hr class="left-line">
		<p>In 184 BC, the Mauryan empire collapsed from outside invasion, leading to India being plummeted into a state of political disunity for centuries. It was around this period many smaller empires were formed, such as the Shungas, who patronised Indian culture and created numerous terracotta images and sculptures, the Satavahanas who were south of the Shungas, acting as a bridge of cultural exchange between the Indo-Gangetic plain and the southernmost tip of India, and the Kushan who expanded out of modern-day Afghanistan and played a vital role in the spread of Buddhism across China and Central Asia. From all around the Old World, traders came to Kerela to trade for spices, and this trade also assisted in the spreading of Hinduism and Buddhism to Southeast Asia.
		<br>
		<br>
		At 320 BC, the Gupta Empire would rise from along the Eastern Ganges, and become the second large empire to unify most of India. Following the legacy of the Mauryans, its founder, Chandra Gupta, took his name from the founder of the Mauryan empire and also chose Patalipura as his capital. Unlike the Mauryans, they were smaller, less centralised, and more diplomatic, trading with Malaysia and Indonesia by sea, and exchanged with them cotton, salt, and metal wares for spices and the same with China for silk. They also practiced religious tolerance of Buddhism, even though they were Hindu themselves. They also placed more emphasis on the caste system and were highly patriarchal, reducing the status of women. Eventually, the Gupta Empire would fall like the Mauryans before them from an outside invasion by the Huns, and with their collapse the Golden Age of India ended.</p>

		<h1>Medieval Period<br>(650 - 1526)</h1>	
		<hr class="right-line">
		<p>With the conclusion of the Gupta Empire's reign, the Medieval era began in India, starting out similarly to the Classical era in that the subcontinent was in a state of political disunity, ruled over mostly by independent princes and smaller kingdoms. The 7th century saw a decline of Buddhism in India as Kumārila Bhaṭṭa defended the position on Vedic rituals against Buddhist attacks. Adi Shankra's doctrine of Advaita Vedanta which he spread during his travels across India in the 8th century helped unify the main characteristics of the current thoughts on Hinduism.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the middle of the 9th century, the Chola dynasty rose to power in South India, creating its greatest empire. Under Rajendra Chola I, the empire not only occupied all of South India and a corridor stretching into modern day Bangladesh, but also used its powerful navy to conquer Sri Lanka, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, coastlines from Burma to Vietnam, the Lakshwadeep, the Malay peninsula and much more of South-East Asia. The Cholas excelled at art, religion, and literature, building temples such as Brihadeeswarar Temple and Airavatesvara Temple with a finesse unlike anything previously imagined.
		<br>
		<br>
		Late into the medieval period, the nation would be divided into two, with the Dehli Sultanate in the North and the Vijayanagara Empire to the south. The Dehli Sultanate was a Muslim sutlanate who ruled from Dehli, whose culture fused with Indian culture, leading to 'Indo-Muslim' culture and the birth of the Urdu language. However, the sultanate also sacked many temples. While being able to fend off the Mongol empire with the help of Mamluk slave calvary, they were eventually defeated by Timur, who sacked and destroyed Dehli, killing much of its populace.</p>

		<h1>Early Modern Period<br>(1526 - 1858)</h1>	
		<hr class="left-line">
		<p>The Early Modern Period saw both the rise and fall of the Mughal Empire, and the growing influence of Europe leading to the formation the British Raj at the very end of the period. Babur, a Timurid and descendant from Timur from modern day Uzbekistan, first established the Mughal Empire in 1526, which at its apex controlled much of South Asia and was an economic and manufacturing superpower even greater than Qing China at its time. It's most famous leaders were Akbar The Great who established healthy relations with the Hindus and rolled back Jizya tax for muslims, and Shah Jahah, whose reign was a golden age of Mughal architecture where the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and many other monuments. The Empire however began its decline after the reign of Aurangazeb, as a result of his intolerance and the many defeats the empire faced from the Marathas, Jats, Afghans, and the British.
		<br>
		<br>
		Speaking of, this period also saw the eventual growth of British influence on the region. With the discovery of a new trading route by Vasco Da Gama, the Portugese began setting up trading posts in Goa and other costal cities. The Dutch arrived next followed by the British, who created the East India Company which built factories, first in Masulipatnam(1611) and Surat(1612), as well as winning wars such as the Battle Of Plassey(1757) and Buxar(1764), gaining influence and power over the nation until the revolt of 1857. </p>

		<h1>British Raj<br>(1858-1947)</h1>	
		<hr class="right-line">
		<p>The revolt in 1857 was initiated by a mutiny regarding the cartridges for Enfield rifles made of pig and cow fat, which had to be bitten, but Hindu and Muslim soldiers employed by the company refused to for seperate religious reasons. The mutiny was first started by Mangal Pandey, eventually saw armies and people such as Rani Lakshmibai and Bahadur Shah Jafah, the last Mughal emperor, join in the fight. However, the revolt failed due to the lack of equipment and outside help. The aftermath of the rebellion saw the end of the Mughal Empire and the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British crown, establishing the British Raj.
		<br>
		<br>
		While the British built infrastructure and transport, the many famines that occured during their rule and the discrimination of Indians led to constant conflict between India and the British, leading to many boycotts and movements, which further increased in strength after the Bengal partition in 1905. From 1920, Gandhi's philosophy of ahimsha and satyagraha slowly became the main philosophy behind movements such as the Non-Cooperation Movement(1920-1922) caused by the Jallinwallah Bagh massacre, and the Salt March to protest salt laws, and by 1947, with Britian being crippled by WW2, decided to allow decolonization of India.
		<br>
		<br>
		The British partitioned India, creating the states of West and East Pakistan(now Bangladesh) for Muslims, leading to one of the largest mass migrations in history, with over 12 million people moving between these nations. Independence was declared on 15th August 1947, and so the Republic of India was formed, with Dr Rajendra Prasad as its first President and Jawaharlal Nehru as its prime minister.</p>
